Description: 

  The goal of this project was to find the cause of high returns within the superstore.xls dataset using Tableau. 
You are instructed to present your findings to the CEO of the company and give recommendations based on the results of the analysis. 

  Visualizations were made after using LEFT JOIN to combine two different tables and using a calculated field to get return rate. Return rate 
was made by taking a column called [Returned] (which had the "yes" value if a product was returned, and a null value if the product was not returned) 
and assigned a "1" to the "yes" values and a "0" to the null values. These values were then averaged and would be compared in different visualizations. 
We would then have to construct a story arc that would explain the cause of high returns, with the visualizations as the evidence for our conclusion. 
The visualizations would then be put into a dashboard and then into a storyboard and presented.

  My conclusion was that the "office supplies" category had an incredibly similar return rate when compared to other categories, and yet, would have a much 
higher number of orders when compared to other categories. My recommendation to the company was to investigate quality control and advertising for office supplies. 
For quality control, to ensure that the quality of these products is up to industry standard. And for advertising, to ensure that customers are not being decieved 
before purchasing a product.
