Description: 

  The goal of this project was to analyze real data from Zomato, where we had a great deal of choice over what to analyze. 
We could choose a restaurant analysis (what restaurants are popular/generate the highest revenue?), customer analysis (Who are
Zomato's customers?, What is their purchasing behaviour?), or sales analysis (main KPI's, change in distribution of sales, etc.). 
I chose a restaurant analysis.
